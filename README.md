# 🍳 Smart Kitchen Automation Using Arduino

An Arduino-based smart kitchen system that integrates motion-sensing lighting and gas/smoke detection for emergency response. Designed to enhance safety, conserve energy, and make home automation affordable.

---

 ✨ Features
- ✅ Motion-sensing LED lighting using IR & Ultrasonic sensors.
- ✅ Gas/smoke leak detection using MQ sensors with buzzer alert.
- ✅ Energy-efficient and improves kitchen safety.
- ✅ Easily extendable with app/voice integration in future.

🔧 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- IR Sensors
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Gas/Smoke Sensor (MQ-2 or MQ-135)
- Buzzer
- LED Lights
- Relay Module
- Breadboard and wires

🚀 How It Works
1. Motion is detected → lights automatically turn on.
2. If gas or smoke is detected → buzzer activates.
3. Lights turn off after a timeout if no motion.
